Hello, world! I'm ifeigen. 

The name "ifeigen" holds a special meaning to me, as it combines two essential elements of my life: computer science and physics. 
- `if` represents the conditional statements in programming
- `eigen` refers to the fundamental concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in physics. 

These two subjects have shaped my passion and curiosity, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you through this blog.

## The Inspiration Behind the Blog

As I've navigated through life, I've come to realize the wealth of knowledge and insights I've gained along the way. It dawned on me that one day, I may no longer be here to share my stories and ideas. That's when I decided to create this blogâ€”to immortalize myself and my thoughts, just as people throughout history have done. But instead of relying on scribes, I have the power to write my own narrative and share my passion with the world through the magic of code.

## Exploring a Myriad of Topics

While computer science and science will undoubtedly be the primary focus of this blog, I'm eager to delve into a wide range of subjects that captivate me. From human psychology, to arts and religion, my goal is to offload the web of ideas and reflections in my mind such that I can see them clearly laid out.

## Closure

Thank you for visiting this blog. I'm excited to be sharing my thoughts and reflections on this platform.
